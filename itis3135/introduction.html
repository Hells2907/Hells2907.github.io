            <li style="text-align: left;"><strong>Personal Background:</strong> I am an international student from India, currently pursuing a degree in Computer Science with a minor in Mathematics. The journey that brought me here has been both exciting and transformative. Leaving my home country to pursue higher education here was a significant step, and I am grateful for the opportunities that this experience has provided me. Living in the USA has been an incredible adventure. I have fallen in love with the diverse culture, the vibrant cities, and the endless opportunities for learning. However, amidst the excitement of this new chapter, I can’t help but feel the pangs of missing my mother back in India. She has always been my pillar of strength, and the distance between us has made me appreciate her even more. Despite the physical separation, we stay connected through regular calls and video chats, which help bridge the gap and keep our bonding.</li>
            
            <li style="text-align: left;"><strong>Professional Background:</strong> I am a dedicated person pursuing a computer science degree with a mathematics minor, leveraging my academic journey to cultivate a foundation in problem-solving and analytical thinking.
